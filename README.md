# Water Allocation Optimization
A tool that uses a linear program to optimize water allocations
when we have data for wells (but not where the water was applied),
demands by parcel (without information on well source), crop
information by parcel, crop associated with well production (sometimes),
and parcel groups and distances that can be assumed to be part of a
connected set.

## Installation
On Windows, requires a conda environment with `cvxpy` installed in it.

## Input Data
Many sources - Nick to add details here
